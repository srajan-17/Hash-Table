# Project: Hash Table

# This project is an implementation of a hash table data structure. The hash table can hold key-value pairs. It does so by storing the pairs in a linked list, which is hashed in a specific index in the hash table. Functions are included which allow the user to insert or remove a pair from the hash table, as well as search for a pair in the table with its key and obtain the amount of used space in the table. In addition, if the number of pairs in any hashed linked list reaches 8, that linked list is converted into a binary search tree, and if the number of pairs of any hashed tree becomes less than 6, the tree is converted into a linked list.

# This project was written using C++.
